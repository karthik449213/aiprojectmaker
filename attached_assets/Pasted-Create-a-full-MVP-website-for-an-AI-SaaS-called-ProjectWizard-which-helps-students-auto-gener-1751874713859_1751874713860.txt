Create a full MVP website for an AI SaaS called **"ProjectWizard"**, which helps students auto-generate academic project content like titles, abstracts, objectives, and references using AI.

💡 Purpose:
To save time for college and school students by generating full project blueprints instantly. No backend or real API in MVP — just mocked responses with future integration points.

🧑‍🎓 Target Audience:
College and high school students doing academic projects (IT, science, management, arts, etc.)

⚙️ Features (MVP Version):
- Input: Project topic + category selection (dropdown)
- Output (mocked): 
   - Project Title
   - Abstract
   - Objective
   - Tools/Technology suggestions
   - Reference list
- Copy buttons for each section
- “Generate Again” button
- Show loader/animation for fake AI effect

📄 Pages:
1. **Home Page**
   - Clean headline: “AI Project Maker for Students”
   - Subheadline: “Generate titles, abstracts, objectives & more from just a topic.”
   - Hero image or SVG
   - CTA Button: “Start Project Wizard”
   - Benefits section (cards with icons): Saves Time, Smart Content, Stress-Free
   - “How it works” section (3 steps)
   - Placeholder ad sections: `<!-- Ad Placeholder 1 -->`, etc.

2. **Tool Page** (`/project-helper`)
   - Input form:
     - Project topic (textarea)
     - Dropdown: Select stream (Engineering, Management, Science, etc.)
     - Button: “Generate Project Content”
   - Output area:
     - Mocked AI response (e.g., static text from JavaScript or JSON)
     - Include animation using `setTimeout()` for realism
   - “Copy All” button
   - Ad placeholder on side or bottom
   - Footer with contact and privacy policy

3. **About Page**
   - Who it’s for, how it works, and why it’s free

4. **Contact Page (Optional - Mock Form)**

🧠 Backend Logic (Mock Only):
- No real OpenAI/API integration
- Use JavaScript + `setTimeout()` to simulate AI processing delay
- All responses are dummy/static in MVP
- Comments included in code: `// TODO: Integrate OpenAI API here`

🎨 UI/UX:
- Professional look like Notion, Framer, or Midjourney
- Fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Modern font (Inter or Poppins)
- Glassmorphism effect on cards
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Cool animation on Generate button
- Scroll-based animations (AOS or pure CSS)
- Tailwind CSS preferred (optional)

📦 Tech Stack:
- HTML, CSS (or Tailwind), JavaScript
- No backend
- Deploy-ready to Netlify, Replit, Vercel
- Save inputs using `localStorage` (bonus)

📈 SEO Ready:
- Meta Tags: “AI Project Generator”, “Generate Academic Abstract”, “Final Year Project Helper”, “Student Project AI Tool”

- Favicon: robot or book icon

💰 Ads & Monetization:
